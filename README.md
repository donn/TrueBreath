# üó£Ô∏è TrueBreath: Respiratory Rate Measurement using the TrueDepth Camera

For a mobile & pervasive computing course paper. This app is a proof-of-concept
breathing rate measurement device using the TrueDepth cameras on iPhone X and
higher models.

## Architecture

## Components

There's an iOS app that has to be run on an iPhone that supports Face ID. It's
based on Apple's
[Streaming Depth Data from the TrueDepth Camera](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/additional_data_capture/streaming_depth_data_from_the_truedepth_camera)
code example, albeit with the point cloud component removed and the ability to
record a minute of data to be uploaded to a server component (under `server/`)
added. We fix the recording at 5 fps, which is still above the Nyquist
frequency for human breathing (2Hz.)

The server component is responsible for calculating the breathing rate. Writing
the calculation of the breathing rate to the phone in Swift is left as an
exercise to the reader.

Here's how to test the app:

1. Prop your phone up at about arm's length at neck height, in landscape mode
   (I propped it up against my monitor.)
1. Use a metronome such as the one at https://www.musicca.com/metronome; set the
   bpm to your target breathing rate * 2, then alternate breathing in and out
   with every beat.
1. Start the server in `server/simple_server.py`. Make sure your phone and Mac
   are connected to the same network.
1. Update the URLs in `TrueBreath/CameraViewController.swift` to target your
   computer, then build and run the app. Wait for the app to launch.
1. Take a few breaths, then tap record, maintaining the same breathing rate
1. Wait one minute, then the server should print your breathing rate to stdout
